I'm an entrepreneurial data science enthusiast with a background in business and engineering. In my current role as a product owner at Volkswagen I am driving digital initiatives to build value-creating data products for our customers, partners, and company. 


When I'm not on the job, I love going hiking, experiencing the culture of foreign countries, and composing music on my guitar, bass, and computer. I absolutely love music.
